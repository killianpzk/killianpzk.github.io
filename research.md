My research interest lies in macro-finance, specifically understanding how distributional frictions affect asset prices and market functioning, especially in short-term funding markets. I am particularly interested in settings where financial intermediaries and market institutions play a central role in shaping prices and influencing the transmission of monetary policy.

### Master Thesis: "The Impact of Interest Rate Hikes on Energy Markets"
* Investigating the causal effect of high-frequency monetary policy shocks on future energy investments.
* Constructing a novel dataset merging policy surprises with US interconnection queues to estimate the interest rate sensitivity of planned renewable projects, which captures forward-looking investment decisions rather than realized capacity.
* **Supervisor:** Prof. Olivier Darmouni (HEC Paris).

### Nowcasting Sovereign Bond Spreads with NLP (Ongoing)
* *(Group Project with [Carla Lucas](https://github.com/carlalucas) & [Elyan Rougon](https://github.com/elyanrgn))*
* Developing a nowcasting model for the OAT-Bund spread using textual analysis of financial news.
* Studying how belief-related soft information is incorporated into sovereign bond prices to understand market sentiment.
* **Supervisor:** Prof. Roland Rathelot (CREST).

### Replication of a TC-VAR Model (Luca Fosso, 2025)
* *(Group Project with [Elyan Rougon](https://github.com/elyanrgn))*
* Reproduced the methodology and findings of the TC-VAR model presented in Luca Fosso's 2025 paper.

### Machine Learning Project
* *(Group Project with [Elyan Rougon](https://github.com/elyanrgn))*
* Conducted a comprehensive benchmark comparing traditional macroeconometric models with modern machine learning methods to forecast French exports and imports.
* Applied the machine learning framework of Medeiros et al. (2021) to a high-dimensional Euro Area dataset.

### Literature Review: Loss Aversion and Collateral
* Conducted a comprehensive literature review examining the theoretical and empirical relationship between loss aversion and collateral constraints in financial markets.
* **Supervisor:** Prof. Guillaume Vuillemey (HEC).

### Applied Statistics Project
* *(Group Project)*
* Conducted a hedonic price study of Parisian apartment prices using the French Real Estate Transaction Database ("Demandes de valeurs foncières").
* **Supervisor:** Prof. Thierry Kamionka (CREST).

### Banque de France Challenge (Winner)
* Literature review on HANK-RANK models and empirical analysis of interest rate pass-through and monetary transmission.
* Focused on distributional and financial channels using panel data.
* **Supervisor:** Guillaume Horny.
